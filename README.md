# 🖥️ Collaborative Working and Code Learning Website  

An **online compiler and collaborative coding platform** that allows users to write, execute, and learn programming together in real time. Built as a **B.Tech Major Project (2023–2024)**, it combines a compiler, collaboration tools, and a code management system into a single web-based solution.

## 🚀 Features  

- **Multi-language Online Compiler**  
  Supports C, C++, Java, and Python with custom input/output execution.  

- **Collaborative Editing**  
  Multiple users can code together in real time (like Google Docs for coding).  

- **Code Saving & Management**  
  - *Quick Save*: Store code temporarily without login.  
  - *Permanent Save*: Logged-in users can save and retrieve code from MongoDB Atlas.  
  - *Search Functionality*: Search saved code by title or keywords.  

- **User Authentication**  
  Secure login/signup system with session management.  

- **Interactive UI**  
  Built using **Bootstrap** + **CodeMirror** for a modern and responsive IDE-like editor.  

- **FAQ Page**  
  Helps beginners understand usage and troubleshoot common issues.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

**Frontend:**  
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript  
- CodeMirror (for editor)  

**Backend:**  
- Node.js, Express.js  
- WebSockets (for real-time collaboration)  

**Database:**

## 📐 System Architecture  

The project follows a **three-tier architecture**:  
1. **Frontend (Presentation Layer):** UI built with Bootstrap + CodeMirror.  
2. **Backend (Application Layer):** Node.js + Express.js handling compiler APIs, authentication, and collaboration.  
3. **Database Layer:** MongoDB Atlas storing user data, code snippets, and search indexes.
